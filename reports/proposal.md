# NybbleRoom Project Proposal: Online Chat Room

#### Leon Lam, Erica Lee, and Emily Yeh

#### Spring 2018

## Description

Our primary goal for this project is to learn how to use C in the context of network programming, clients, and servers. We will figure out what web applications with multiple concurrent users need, such as multiple threads.

In order to achieve these learning goals, we will create a chat room with an interface where users can play multiplayer games with each other online. Our minimum viable product is a chat room that allows multiple users to talk with each other, as well as play a simple multiplayer game by sending commands to the server.

A stretch goal that we might work towards is allowing players to play more complex games, like Hunt the Wumpus or Battleship.

## Next Steps

The first part of the project that we would like to accomplish is creating a functioning chat room. This task can be broken up into several steps:

1) Researching some tutorials for chat rooms, as well as implementations that use C/C++, and finding some readings on the backend functions that handle user inputs and states. All team members will participate in this step.

2) Hosting our web application online using a service like Heroku. All team members will participate in this step.

3) Creating some backend functions that recognize commands that the users might input to the web application. All team members will participate in this step, but we might assign different functions to different members - for example, one team member will work on a function for recognizing user commands, another team member will work on starting a game when a certain command is inputted, and the last team member will work on various pieces of the game, and so on.
